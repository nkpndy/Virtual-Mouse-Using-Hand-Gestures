# Virtual-Mouse-Using-Hand-Gestures
he virtual mouse project leverages computer vision and hand tracking to
enable users to control their computer's cursor using hand gestures. The project uses
a webcam to capture real-time video, processes the video to detect hand landmarks,
and maps hand movements to cursor movements on the screen.
